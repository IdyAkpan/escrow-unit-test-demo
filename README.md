# Escrow Contract
This is Typescript project, using VSCode is highly recommended.

## Installation

`yarn`
`yarn build`
`yarn watch`
`yarn start`

or with npm

`npm install`
`npm run build`
`npm run watch`
`npm start`

## The Challenge

Take some time to understand the design of `Account.ts` and `EscrowContract.ts`. Feel free to ask any questions you may have.

After you feel that you have a good enough understanding of the project, especially how the `EscrowState` can transition. Please complete the `TODO`s as best as you can.

In `index.ts` we ask that you write *unit tests* to test the correctness of the `EscrowState` transitions. One way to do that would be to write a program that will attempt all exposed transitions and make sure that only the ones that are allowed by the spec succeed. 

## Solution by Robert Lombardo

After installing: run the tests with `npm run test`
